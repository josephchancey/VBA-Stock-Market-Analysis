# VBA-Stock-Market-Analysis
Exploring green energy stock performance by analyzing financial data using VBA in Excel.

### Goal
The goal for this project is to create a script that will analyze stock data and output data into columns I,J,K,L. The output results are the Ticker symbol, yearly change for that symbol, percentage change for that symbol, and the total volume for that symbol. 

### Files
The attached script can be run with the attached alphabetical_testing.xlsx file. This script can also be run on other datasets that fit the alphabetical_testing.xlsx's format. 

### Results
Annual results (Note that these screenshots are not from the alphabetical_testing.xlsx, rather, the script is being run on a larger dataset of 700,000+ rows)
